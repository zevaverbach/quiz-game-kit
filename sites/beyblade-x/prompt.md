Please have a look at this repo.

Then let's create a new repo beside it called beyblade-x-quiz-game.

We'll leave the styling as it is at first: Focus your efforts on generating the first 100 high-quality beyblade x questions. No questions about

1) history
2) beyblades other than the X series

Be sure to not accidentally hint at the right answer:

  a) randomize the positions of the correct answers
  b) keep the answers roughly the same length and format, with similar levels of detail

did you push it?

yes please do that!
