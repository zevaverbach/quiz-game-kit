using the following guideline, make a flashy Greek myth trivia again. Use local storage to track which questions have already been answered via given user.:

self-contained HTML file, vanilla JavaScript, no build step, load any dependencies from a CDN

this is great!!

it looks perfect even in a small screen (iphone 12 mini)

can you make it so there's no vertical scroll required on a screen that size?

then would you please add 500 more questions? feel free to make some of them more difficult

please don't present all 530 to the player! each game should only consist of 20 questions.

please favor questions a) the user hasn't seen yet and/or b) questions the user hasn't gotten right yet. b) will require tracking that, again using local storage

Please make it so that the player's name is remembered! (stored in localstorage)

also it seems like a suspicious number of the right ansers are "A"

then, are you certain there's no more vertical scroll required on mobile? haven't tested it, but on a 16" macbook pro screen it's still requiring vertical scroll

this is broken on mobile now :

better! we need more room for the answers though, the contents must be scrolled currently to see the options -- take it away from the top of the screen-- we don't need "change hero" during a quiz

please link to an appropriate wikipedia page/section in all the "did you know" sections, but also as a tiny link provided when you get a wrong answer

thank you!

unfortunately, you've crafted the available answers in a way that makes it very easy to guess which one is the right answer most of the time:

When you use parentheses in an answer, that's the correct one, or with a complex explanation that might have gone in parentheses, often following a hyphen.

when it's an entire phrase as the answer, the longest one is always the correct answer.

can you please systematically review all of the questions and the available answers, and then change them so that there aren't these obvious clues?
