using the kit here, please make a new repo containing a quiz game about system design.

do as much research as is needed to produce high-quality questions and answers, making sure to not accidentally telegraph what the correct answer is: for example, ensure randomization of the _position_ of the right answer. for another exapmle, keep the answers roughly the same length and format, with similar levels of detail

let's start with 200 high-quality questions.

please go ahead and push this up to github -- make a repo if there isn't one already
